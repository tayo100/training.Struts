<h1>Scheduled jobs</h1>
<p>Applications commonly run scheduled jobs that automate parts of application logic. <b>Scheduled jobs manager</b> allows Administrators
to manage the scheduler (pause and resume the scheduler) and trigger jobs manually.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When the scheduler is <b>paused</b> no scheduled jobs will trigger.</p>

<h2>Job details</h2>

<p>You cannot schedule additional jobs using the Administrator tools. Jobs can only be defined by application developers.</p>
