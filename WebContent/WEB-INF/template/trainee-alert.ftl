Dear ${trainee.person.fullName},

We attached a reporting format for your use.

The purpose of this activity is to enable you report periodically to your supervisor as would be agreed during your first meeting to determine your workplan.  During the course of this reporting exercise, if it becomes obvious that your program is not progressing as planned  and where there is possibility of an  extension of the duration of program, this would alert all  parties be aware and be prepared.   At the end of the reporting period, the form should be forwarded by your Supervisor to Training Unit  for necessary action where needed.  (Training Unit might receive instructions as to change of terms of contract , etc. in case of an extension).

Pls forward all enquiries to IITA-TrainingUnit@cgiar.org
