<h1>Full-text Indexing</h1>
<p>Application uses <b>Apache Lucene</b> to provide full-text search functionality. Data is automatically reindexed by the application as changes occur.
Even so, re-indexing application data is sometimes required.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Reindexing may take a long time!</p>

<h2>When to reindex?</h2>
<p>Application data needs to be reindexed in following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Database was modified using external tools</li>
	<li>Indexes are corrupt</li>
	<li>After restoring data backups</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reindexing parts of database</h2>
<p>Reindexer tool allows you to reindex only relevant parts of the database. Select the data you want reindexed and click <b>Reindex</b> button.</p>

<p>While reindexing is in progress, nobody can schedule another reindexing job until the one running is completed.</p>
