<h1>User's Dashboard</h1>
<p>User's dashboard is the entry point for all (other) users of ProMIS CRM. The screen displays information relevant to the person with which the user is
linked. A user and a person are not the same thing. <b>User</b> is someone who logs into ProMIS CRM.</p>

<p>First time you log in to ProMIS CRM, the system will try to link you with existing CRM person record based on your email, name, etc. If a completely
matching record does not exist in CRM, a new person profile will be generated.</p>
